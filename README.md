# BuffStuff
A place where Buffs can buy and sell their stuff. 

Description: College students can find it difficult to get off campus to buy the things they need. Buff Stuff is an app that allows CU Boulder students to sell and buy goods from other students. That way, the exchanges could happen on campus and students have some additional security knowing they will be meeting with other students.

Organization: This repo contains different branch for each section of the app: Buy, Chat, Login, Sell, and User. These branches contain any initial changes to the code of these features. Once this code is reviewed, it is pulled into develop. At increments, develop is pulled into the master branch when develop has been determined to be bug free.

Instructions: Our app was deployed locally using Android Studio. In order to access and test the app:

-Clone a copy of the project on GitHub to your local machine. Link: https://github.com/cosm9747/BuffStuff

    -Alternatively, if you own an Android phone you can connect the phone to your computer via USB and select “Unknown Device” in the drop down menu next to the play button. Make sure that in your phone settings you have “Developer Mode” turned on.

-Once your AVD is set up, hit the green play button at the top of Android Studio to run the project.
